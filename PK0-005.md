		3. Short cycles (2 weeks avg)
			1. Produces a working iteration of software after each cycle
			2. Just enough planning, building, testing to get critical user feedback
			3. Learn what works and what doesn't my breaking work into small sprints
				1. Inspect and Adapt
			4. Allows for changing of a direction very easily
				1. Respond to market conditions faster
		4. agilemanifesto.org
			1. Value individuals and interactions over processes and tools
			2. Value working software over comprehensive documentation
			3. Value customer collaboration over contract negotiation
				1. Need to respond to changes so work with customers
			4. Responding to changes is more important than following a plan
			5. 12 Principles of Agile
				1. Satisfy the customer with early and continuous delivery of valuable software
				2. Deliver working software frequently, every couple of weeks
				3. Working software is the primary measure of progress
				4. Welcome changing requirements to maintain competitive advantages
				5. Simplicity - maximize the amount of work *not done*
				6. Business people and developers must work together daily
					1. Decisions about scope, dates, budget
				7. Face to face conversations are preferred
				8. Development environment of motivated and supported individuals. No micromanagement.
				9. Maintain a constant pace under sustainable development
				10. Self-organizing teams create the best architectures, requirements
				11. Solid foundations in technical practices with good design
				12. In regular intervals team reflects on how to become more effective then tunes and adjusts
	2. Waterfall
		1. Great for when all requirements are known ahead of time
		2. Traditional project management approach
		3. Each phase relies on the previous
		4. Puts a lot of effort upfront before building anything
		5. Phases
			1. Gather all requirements
			2. Design
			3. Plan
			4. Build
				1. Changes are discouraged. Only essential changes.
			5. Test
			6. Open
	3. Scrum
		1. A popular agile framework (time-boxed sprints, self-organizing developers, scrum master)
		2. Product Owner - a single person (not a committee)
			1. Owns vision of product
			2. Authority to decide what features get built and order 
			3. In charge of product backlog
		3. Product Backlog - a continually evolving prioritized list of work that needs to be done
		4. Less than 10 cross-functional developers on the team (small sized teams)
		5. Scrum master - no managerial authority but they are involved with leadership to promote scrum values to help get the job done
		6. Broken into sprints
			1. Less than a month
		7. Sprint Planning Meeting
			1. Product owner and developers look at the backlog and agree on a sprint

		10. Sprint Review
			1. Product owner, scrum master, developers, and stakeholders review the features and product progress
		11. Sprint Retrospective
			1. Scrum team analyzes the sprint process itself to improve for the next sprint
	4. Kanban
		1. A lean agile apparoch focused on workflow (famous for kanban task board)
		2. Focuses on managing the flow of work (not sprints)
		3. Kanban board
			1. Represents columns of states
			2. Cards of initiatives are placed around the different states until finished
	5. Lean
		1. Derived from manufacturing - remove anything that doesn't add value
		2. Remove anything that doesn't add value
			1. Ineffective meetings
			2. Excessive documentation
		3. If agile probably lean, lean probably agile - has overlap
	6. Extreme Programming
		1. Software engineering best practices
		2. Pair programming
		3. Collective code ownership - every team member makes changes to any code
		4. Test-driven development - create tests before writing code
		5. Spiking - time to explore potential solutions
		6. Refactoring - keep code clutter- fee
		7. Continuous integration - integrate code into repo every few hours to avoid fragmenting development efforts
	7. SAFE "Scaled Agile Framework"
		1. Best practices for scaling agile for a larger enterprise
	8. PRINCE2 (Projects in Controlled Environments)

5. Hybrid Approaches
	1. Mixture of different project frameworks/methodologies
	2. Companies may combine scrum and Kanban - it's fine
	3. Hybrid approaches happen in real life - and that's okay
	4. A company may use an agile framework for software and waterfall for hardware
	5. Different individuals bring their own experiences into the mix
	6. If your project has a successful outcome, it doesn't matter how you got there
6. The Business Case
	1. Report that explains executive benefits of a project which helps decide if the project is worth doing
		1. All about - will the project add value? Business case establishes value of what a project will bring
		2. Expected to be adapted to maximize the expected value throughout the project
		3. Starts as an important, starting document that is used as input to other project management processes
	2. Definition - A value proposition for a proposed project that may include financial and non-financial benefits
	3. Business needs are documented in the business case:
		1. Market demand / customer requests
			1. "We need a mobile app"
		2. Legal or regulatory requirements
			1. "We need to be GDPR compliant"
		3. Something is outdated
			1. "Our CRM is outdated"
	4. Business Case Analysis:
		1. Root Cause
		2. Risks
	5. Strategic Alignment:
		1. is it a good fit for our business?
		2. Shows that the business case aligns to the business' overall vision or strategy
	6. Other options:
		1. Outlines other options to address the business needs
		2. Include a recommendation
	7. Feasibility study:
		1. Is it do-able?
		2. What are the financials?
7. Choosing the correct project among other options
	1. Methods for selecting a project:
		1. Mathematical modeling
			1. Linear programming
			2. Nonlinear programming
			3. Methods for **constrained optimization**
		2. Benefits comparisons
			1. Net Present value (NPV)
				1. Uses an economic theory that is based on the assumption that a value of a sum of money today is worth more than it will be in the future
			2. Return on Investment (ROI)
				1. A percentage that shows how much money you'll make through investing in something
				2. Percent
			3. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
				1. Does the investment have a high or low rate of return?
				2. Percent
			4. Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR)
				1. For every dollar invested, how much do you earn
				2. 1.5:1 1.5 dollars per dollar spent
				3. First figure larger than second
			5. Payback period (PBP)
				1. How long does it take to pay back what was invested in the project
				2. Shorter time the better
			6. Scoring Model
				1. Objective technique - list criteria that is important to you in a project and then weight them based on importance and score each project accordingly
				2. You may have 5 criteria for a project, but you want to weigh each one to see what has a higher importance
				3. Compare the scores across projects to see which one will meet the most important or various criteria
			7. Opportunity Cost
				1. Value of what you give up instead of doing something else
				2. If you invest in one project, you miss out on another, and you lose the opportunity cost
				3. Choose the project that results in the lowest opportunity cost
8. Review procurement preferences & artifacts
	1. Project manager probably doesn't have purchasing authority
	2. Procurement department is in charge of purchasing
	3. Project manager should have some awareness in order to make sensible decisions
		1. PM Should know the following:
			1. What's our preferred procurement method? What's the business preference?
				1. Build/Make
					1. Would it be useful to develop these skills in the organization for better long-term value?
				2. Buy
					1. Is it better to just buy a product from someone else?
				3. Lease
					1. Buy or lease hardware?
				4. Subscribe
					1. Cloud services can be cheaper on a subscription model as needed
					2. Pay-as-you-go
			2. What's our preference for CapEx vs OpEx?
				1. CapEx (Capital Expenditure) -  Major investments which appear on the balance sheet and depreciate over time. Ex) Buy computers 
				2. OpEx (Operational Expenditure) - Relates to ongoing expenses, which are often tax deductible. Ex) Lease computers
			3. What existing procurement artifacts do we have in place?
				1. Artifact - any template, document, output or project deliverable
				2. Pre-qualified Vendors
					1. List of suppliers we already use
				3. Pre-determined Clients
					1. Partner organizations with an agreement to re-sell our product etc
				4. Pre-existing Contracts
					1. Any contracts already signed and in place for procurement of existing goods/services?
			4. What's our process for engaging vendors?
	4. Deciding these questions early reduce delays in procurement during the later project phases
	5. Process for engaging vendors
		1. RFI - Request for Information
			1. Does the vendor have the skills/capacity
			2. Narrow down list of suppliers
		2. RFP - Request for proposal
			1. A proposal may be complex/detailed of the 3 options
			2. Include approach/design/timeline
			3. Evaluate factors beyond just the price
		3. RFQ - Request for quote
			1. You know what you want, just need the price
		4. RFB - Request for bid
			1. A government organization may look at various vendors and compare their price for the lowest 
			2. Often delivered in sealed envelopes
			3. May have requirements like all projects over 100k require an RFB
9. Vendor Contract Types
	1. Buyer - the organization procuring goods or services from the seller
	2. Vendor - Organization providing the good or services to the buyer
	3. Contract - A mutually binding agreement that obligates the vendor to provide the specified product or service and obligates the buyer to pay for it
		1. Usually a written document
		2. Includes scope of work to be performed
		3. Includes terms and conditions
		4. Must have any changes formally controller
		5. Is not fulfilled until all requirements are met
	4. Fixed-price contracts
		1. Total fixed price is set for product or service
		2. Appropriate when scope is well defined and no significant changes are expected
		3. 3 subtypes:
			1. Firm Fixed Price (FFP) - Price fixed at outset and won't change unless scope changes
			2. Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) - Financial incentives if targets are met
			3. Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustments (FPEPA) - Allows for adjustments to cover exchange rates, interest rates, inflation, commodities (oil)
	5. Cost plus contracts
		1. Buy pays the cost plus a fee representing profit for the seller
		2. Appropriate when the scope is expected to change significantly
		3. Subtypes:
			1. Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) - All costs paid by buyer and a fixed fee on completion
			2. Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) - Costs paid by buyer and bonus if targets are met
			3. Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) - All costs reimbursed by buyer, extra fee is awarded based on buyer's judgment of seller's performance 
	6. Time and materials contracts
		1. Contain aspects of both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts
		2. Example:
			1. A plumber may perform work and ask for an hourly rate plus costs of supplies/materials used
10. Other vendor documents
