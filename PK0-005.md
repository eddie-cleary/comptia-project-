1. What is a project?
	1. A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.
	2. Distinct from ongoing operations
	3. Have a beginning and an end
	4. Has a reason or purpose
		1. Create a business value

			3. Learn what works and what doesn't by breaking work into small sprints
				1. Inspect and Adapt
			4. Allows for changing of a direction very easily
				2. Respond to market conditions faster
		4. agilemanifesto.org
			1. Value individuals and interactions over processes and tools
			2. Value working software over comprehensive documentation
			3. Value customer collaboration over contract negotiation
				1. Need to respond to changes so work with customers
			4. Responding to changes is more important than following a plan
			5. 12 Principles of Agile
				1. Satisfy the customer with early and continuous delivery of valuable software
				2. Deliver working software frequently, every couple of weeks
				3. Working software is the primary measure of progress
				4. Welcome changing requirements to maintain competitive advantages
				5. Simplicity - maximize the amount of work *not done*
				6. Business people and developers must work together daily
					1. Decisions about scope, dates, budget
				7. Face to face conversations are preferred
				8. Development environment of motivated and supported individuals. No micromanagement.
				9. Maintain a constant pace under sustainable development
				10. Self-organizing teams create the best architectures, requirements
				11. Solid foundations in technical practices with good design

	2. Waterfall
		1. Great for when all requirements are known ahead of time
		2. Traditional project management approach
		3. Each phase relies on the previous
		4. Puts a lot of effort upfront before building anything
		5. Phases
			1. Gather all requirements
			2. Design
			3. Plan
			4. Build
				1. Changes are discouraged. Only essential changes.
			5. Test
			6. Open
	3. Scrum
		1. A popular agile framework (time-boxed sprints, self-organizing developers, scrum master)
		2. Product Owner - a single person (not a committee)
			1. Owns vision of product
			2. Authority to decide what features get built and order 
			3. In charge of product backlog
		3. Product Backlog - a continually evolving prioritized list of work that needs to be done
		4. Less than 10 cross-functional developers on the team (small sized teams)
		5. Scrum master - no managerial authority but they are involved with leadership to promote scrum values to help get the job done
		6. Broken into sprints
			1. Less than a month
		7. Sprint Planning Meeting

	4. Kanban
		1. A lean agile apparoch focused on workflow (famous for kanban task board)
		2. Focuses on managing the flow of work (not sprints)
		3. Kanban board
			1. Represents columns of states
			2. Cards of initiatives are placed around the different states until finished
	5. Lean
		1. Derived from manufacturing - remove anything that doesn't add value
		2. Remove anything that doesn't add value
			1. Ineffective meetings
			2. Excessive documentation
		3. If agile probably lean, lean probably agile - has overlap
	6. Extreme Programming
		1. Software engineering best practices
		2. Pair programming
		3. Collective code ownership - every team member makes changes to any code
		4. Test-driven development - create tests before writing code
		5. Spiking - time to explore potential solutions
		6. Refactoring - keep code clutter- fee
		7. Continuous integration - integrate code into repo every few hours to avoid fragmenting development efforts
	7. SAFE "Scaled Agile Framework"
		1. Best practices for scaling agile for a larger enterprise
	8. PRINCE2 (Projects in Controlled Environments)

		3. Hybrid approaches happen in real life - and that's okay
		4. A company may use an agile framework for software and waterfall for hardware
		5. Different individuals bring their own experiences into the mix
		6. If your project has a successful outcome, it doesn't matter how you got there
5. Project Lifecycle
	1. The series of phases that a project goes through from its start to finish
		1. Discovery/Concept Preparation
		2. Initiation
		3. Planning
		4. Execution
		5. Closing
6. Discovery / Concept Preparation Phase
	1. Some activities that take place in this lifecycle phase:
		1. The Project Business Case
		2. Choosing which project to do
		3. Review procurement processes and artifacts
		4. Vendor contract types
		5. Other vendor documents
	2. The Business Case
		6. Report that explains executive benefits of a project which helps decide if the project is worth doing
			1. All about - will the project add value? Business case establishes value of what a project will bring
			2. Expected to be adapted to maximize the expected value throughout the project
			3. Starts as an important, starting document that is used as input to other project management processes
		7. Definition - A value proposition for a proposed project that may include financial and non-financial benefits
		8. Business needs are documented in the business case:
			4. Market demand / customer requests
				1. "We need a mobile app"
			5. Legal or regulatory requirements
				2. "We need to be GDPR compliant"
			6. Something is outdated
				1. "Our CRM is outdated"
		9. Business Case Analysis:
			7. Root Cause
			8. Risks
		10. Strategic Alignment:
			9. is it a good fit for our business?
			10. Shows that the business case aligns to the business' overall vision or strategy
		11. Other options:
			11. Outlines other options to address the business needs
			12. Include a recommendation
		12. Feasibility study:
			13. Is it do-able?
			14. What are the financials?
	3. Choosing the correct project among other options
		1. Methods for selecting a project:
			1. Mathematical modeling
				1. Linear programming
				2. Nonlinear programming
				3. Methods for **constrained optimization**
			2. Benefits comparisons
				4. Net Present value (NPV)
					1. Uses an economic theory that is based on the assumption that a value of a sum of money today is worth more than it will be in the future
				5. Return on Investment (ROI)
					1. A percentage that shows how much money you'll make through investing in something
					2. Percent
				6. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
					1. Does the investment have a high or low rate of return?
					2. Percent
				7. Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR)
					1. For every dollar invested, how much do you earn
					2. 1.5:1 1.5 dollars per dollar spent
					3. First figure larger than second
				8. Payback period (PBP)
					4. How long does it take to pay back what was invested in the project
					5. Shorter time the better
				9. Scoring Model
					1. Objective technique - list criteria that is important to you in a project and then weight them based on importance and score each project accordingly
					2. You may have 5 criteria for a project, but you want to weigh each one to see what has a higher importance
					3. Compare the scores across projects to see which one will meet the most important or various criteria
				10. Opportunity Cost
					4. Value of what you give up instead of doing something else
					5. If you invest in one project, you miss out on another, and you lose the opportunity cost
					6. Choose the project that results in the lowest opportunity cost
	4. Review procurement preferences & artifacts
		2. Project manager probably doesn't have purchasing authority
		3. Procurement department is in charge of purchasing
		4. Project manager should have some awareness in order to make sensible decisions
			1. PM Should know the following:
				1. What's our preferred procurement method? What's the business preference?
					1. Build/Make
						1. Would it be useful to develop these skills in the organization for better long-term value?
					2. Buy
						2. Is it better to just buy a product from someone else?
					3. Lease
						1. Buy or lease hardware?
					4. Subscribe
						2. Cloud services can be cheaper on a subscription model as needed
						3. Pay-as-you-go
				2. What's our preference for CapEx vs OpEx?
					1. CapEx (Capital Expenditure) -  Major investments which appear on the balance sheet and depreciate over time. Ex) Buy computers 
					2. OpEx (Operational Expenditure) - Relates to ongoing expenses, which are often tax deductible. Ex) Lease computers
				3. What existing procurement artifacts do we have in place?
					1. Artifact - any template, document, output or project deliverable
					2. Pre-qualified Vendors
						1. List of suppliers we already use
					3. Pre-determined Clients
						1. Partner organizations with an agreement to re-sell our product etc
					4. Pre-existing Contracts
						2. Any contracts already signed and in place for procurement of existing goods/services?
				4. What's our process for engaging vendors?
		5. Deciding these questions early reduce delays in procurement during the later project phases
		6. Process for engaging vendors
			2. RFI - Request for Information
				1. Does the vendor have the skills/capacity
				2. Narrow down list of suppliers
			3. RFP - Request for proposal
				1. A proposal may be complex/detailed of the 3 options
				2. Include approach/design/timeline
				3. Evaluate factors beyond just the price
			4. RFQ - Request for quote
				4. You know what you want, just need the price
			5. RFB - Request for bid
				1. A government organization may look at various vendors and compare their price for the lowest 
				2. Often delivered in sealed envelopes
				3. May have requirements like all projects over 100k require an RFB
	5. Vendor Contract Types
		1. Buyer - the organization procuring goods or services from the seller
		2. Vendor - Organization providing the good or services to the buyer
		3. Contract - A mutually binding agreement that obligates the vendor to provide the specified product or service and obligates the buyer to pay for it
			1. Usually a written document
			2. Includes scope of work to be performed
			3. Includes terms and conditions
			4. Must have any changes formally controller
			5. Is not fulfilled until all requirements are met
		4. Fixed-price contracts
			6. Total fixed price is set for product or service
			7. Appropriate when scope is well defined and no significant changes are expected
			8. 3 subtypes:
				1. Firm Fixed Price (FFP) - Price fixed at outset and won't change unless scope changes
				2. Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) - Financial incentives if targets are met
				3. Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustments (FPEPA) - Allows for adjustments to cover exchange rates, interest rates, inflation, commodities (oil)
		5. Cost plus contracts
			9. Buy pays the cost plus a fee representing profit for the seller
			10. Appropriate when the scope is expected to change significantly
			11. Subtypes:
				4. Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) - All costs paid by buyer and a fixed fee on completion
				5. Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) - Costs paid by buyer and bonus if targets are met
				6. Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) - All costs reimbursed by buyer, extra fee is awarded based on buyer's judgment of seller's performance 
		6. Time and materials contracts
			12. Contain aspects of both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts
			13. Example:
				1. A plumber may perform work and ask for an hourly rate plus costs of supplies/materials used
	6. Other vendor documents
		7. Most organizations will have previously used templates
		8. Statement of Work (SOW) - Details of services or goods the buyer wants to purchase so the vendor knows what we're asking them to provide
		9. Terms of Reference (TOR) - Description of the work requirement (the scope, timeline, resources)
			14. Sounds similar to statement of work, organizations may use either to communicate the work to the vendor
			15. Statement of work is typically better for goods purchases
			16. Terms of reference is typically better for services purchases
			17. Organizations may use either, some even use a statement of work as the main document with terms of reference as an additional document for further details
		10. Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) - May need to have vendor agree to an NDA if they'll be exposed to sensitive information or trade secrets you don't want shared
		11. Cease and Desist Letter (C&D Letter) - Used to stop somebody doing something immediately. Any party may be violating a copyright or patent. Sent by lawyers.
		12. Letter of Intent - Describes the intention of what the buyer and vendor are going to do, usually before they enter into a contract. Not always legally binding, but can carry weight
		13. Memorandum of Understanding - Not legally enforceable but might be useful to outline responsibilities when it's not possible to create a legal agreement between parties
			18. An agreement within an organization or within the government so it can't be legally binding since it's used within
		14. Master Service Agreement (MSA) - An umbrella agreement to set general terms between parties which can help streamline future contracts
			19. Might be useful for agile projects with the TOR providing more details for each iteration
		15. Service Level Agreement (SLA) - Defines expectations of the level of service to be provided by the vendor (how quickly issues are responded to)
		16. Maintenance Agreement - Describes what the vendor is expected to do in order to keep the goods or service up and running
		17. Warranty - The vendor's guarantee that the product will perform as expected for a specified period of time
			20. Vendor may need to fix or replace within warranty
		18. Purchase Order (PO) - Official document issued by a buyer committing to pay the seller for the sale of specific products or services
7. Initiation Phase
	1. Some activities that take place in this lifecycle phase:
		1. Develop the project charter
		2. Identify and assess stakeholders
		3. Develop a responsibility assignment matrix
		4. Establish accepted communication channels
		5. Determine solution design
		6. Develop a records management plan
		7. Define access requirements
		8. Review existing artifacts
		9. Conduct project kickoff meetings
	2. Develop the Project Charter
		10. Project Charter - the document issued by the project sponsor that formally authorizes the existence of a project
			1. Likely written by the project manager and approved by the project sponsor
			2. What does it contain?
				1. May have previously used templates within organization
				2. Project purpose and high level requirements, objectives
					1. Business needs and justification (business case)
				3. Overall project risk
				4. Summary of schedule and budget (high-level milestones)
				5. Key stakeholders
				6. Success criteria and approval
					1. Input from sponsor & stakeholders
				7. Exit criteria
					1. Under what conditions might the project need to be cancelled
					2. Constraints 
				8. Project manager name and level of authority
			3. Sets initial boundaries, aligns expectations, & describes success
			4. Different from Business Case
				1. Project charter provides high level information to define the project 
					1. Key objective: Authorize the project to begin
				2. Business case is a value proposition that includes business needs, options, recommendations, feasibility study
					2. Key objective: Should the project proceed?
		11. Project sponsor - person/group who provides resources and support for the project and is accountable for enabling success
	3. Identify and Assess Stakeholders
		1. Stakeholder - an individual, group, or organization that may affect, be affected by or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project
			1. Internal
				1. Sponsor
				2. Program manager
				3. Team members
				4. Other managers
			2. External
				1. Customers
				2. End users
				3. Suppliers
				4. Shareholders
				5. Competitors
		2. Why is it important to identify key stakeholders?
			1. Reduces risk of stakeholders being affected negatively at the end of the project. 
			2. Stakeholders should be identified at the beginning of the project in order to prevent negative effects to the stakeholder at the end of the project
				1. Example) a project gets build that negatively impacts a stakeholder due to an oversight in the project's design. If a stakeholder is aware of the project early on they can help to mitigate any impacts 
		3. Assessing stakeholders
			1. Identifying expectations from each stakeholder
			2. What is their influence on the project
			3. Whose needs should be taken into account?
			4. Helps us prioritize relationships
			5. How to assess:
				1. Classification grids - power/influence, power/interest, impact/influence
					1. a 2 column grid that allows you to see where stakeholders rank in the above categories
				2. Stakeholder cube 
					2. 3d version for 3 factors
					3. Can show relationship of Power, influence, impact or any other quality
				3. Salience model
					1. Venn diagram of 2 or more categories
				4. Directions of influence
					2. A chart that shows direction of influence for each stakeholder
					3. Directions examples:
						1. Upwards + sideways (up to sr managers and peers)
						2. Downwards (sr managers down to a team)
						3. outwards (relationships with vendors)
			6. Stakeholder Register
				1. Identification information (name, contact details, role)
				2. Assessment information (requirements/expectations)
				3. Stakeholder classification - (internal/external, rating of power/influence)
	4. Develop a Responsibility Assignment Matrix
		4. RAM (Responsibility Assignment Matrix)
			1. Provides clarity and structure about the roles of key stakeholders
			2. Helps to establish stakeholder engagement and buy-in early-on in the project
		5. RACI, a type of RAM, stands for:
			1. Responsible
				1. Responsible for doing the work
			2. Accountable
				2. Person who approves the work
			3. Consulted
				1. Someone who provided input to the work
				2. Can be multiple
			4. Informed
				1. Someone who needs to be kept in the loop
				2. Can be multiple
			5. Shows the different levels of accountability
	5. Agile Product Vision and Product Roadmap
		1. Product vision - a short, high level statement outlining the business purpose of a product
		2. Can be harder to write this in an agile product since change is expected
			1. Create a product visioning workshop in order to:
				1. Extract what's really important
				2. Provides clarity for everyone
				3. Sets expectations for the customer
				4. Identify risks
				5. Convert features into benefits
		3. Product Roadmap - a strategic planning tool that provides general time frames for major themes of the product creation
	6. Project Kick-off
		4. Once the project charter is approved by project sponsor, the project can begin, but first - you need a kick-off meeting
		5. Kick-off meeting - first official meeting between the project team and sponsor
			1. Make introductions of key stakeholders
			2. Communicate project purpose and goals 
				1. Reinforces team building
				2. Increases cohesive purpose among the team
			3. Set expectations
				1. Summary schedule
				2. Budget
				3. Challenges/Risks
				4. Deadlines
				5. Procedure highlighting
				6. Clarify roles and responsibilities

		3. Define units of work
		4. Assess the resource pool
		5. Assign project resources
		6. Develop a schedule
		7. Determine budget
		8. Assess risks
		9. Develop a transition plan
	2. Develop a project management plan
		1. Main output from the planning phase
			1. Definition: defines how the project is executed, monitored and controlled, and closed
			2. Has a lot of components and subsidiary plans
				1. Communications Plan
				2. Risks plan
				3. Resources plan
				4. etc.
			3. Includes 4 baselines (reference points for measuring progress)
				1. Scope
				2. Performance measurement
				3. Cost
				4. Schedule
	3. Develop a Detailed Scope Statement
		1. Product Scope vs Project scope
			1. Product scope - specific features and functions that characterize what we're creating
				1. how the product will function
			2. Project scope - all of the work performed to deliver the product
				1. tools and processes to build the product
		2.
